# LLM-Parallel-SO-for-KELM

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper **"A Novel Parallel Snake Optimizer with LLM-Enhanced Cross-Population Communication for KELM Hyperparameter Optimization and Applied in Power Load Forecasting"**.

## Overview

Our method leverages a novel parallel Snake Optimizer (SO) framework enhanced by Large Language Model (LLM)-based cross-population communication to intelligently optimize Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) hyperparameters. The proposed approach achieves superior prediction accuracy for power load forecasting through an innovative optimization strategy that combines swarm intelligence with LLM-guided information exchange between subpopulations, effectively balancing global exploration and local exploitation while maintaining computational efficiency.
